# Roller-Coaster-Dataset-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-
This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project using a dataset of roller coasters from around the world. The project provides insights into roller coaster attributes, such as their locations, manufacturers, operational statuses, and thrilling specifications like speed, height, and inversions.
**Dataset Attributes**
The dataset used in this analysis contains the following attributes:

**coaster_name** (object): Name of the roller coaster.
**Location** (object): Location of the roller coaster (e.g., park, city, or country).
**Status** (object): Operational status (e.g., "Operating," "Closed").
**Manufacturer** (object): Company or manufacturer responsible for the coaster.
**year_introduced** (int64): Year the coaster was introduced.
**latitude** (float64): Latitude of the coaster's location.
**longitude** (float64): Longitude of the coaster's location.
**Type_Main** (object): Main type of the roller coaster (e.g., Steel, Wooden).
**opening_date_clean** (object): Cleaned and standardized opening date of the coaster.
**speed_mph** (float64): Maximum speed of the coaster in miles per hour.
**height_ft** (float64): Maximum height of the coaster in feet.
**Inversions_clean** (int64): Number of inversions on the coaster.
**Gforce_clean** (float64): Maximum G-force experienced on the coaster.

**Objectives**
**Data Cleaning:** Handle missing, incorrect, or inconsistent values in the dataset.

**Exploratory Data Analysis:**

Understand patterns and distributions of coaster features.
Identify trends based on location, manufacturer, and year of introduction.
Analyze the relationships between height, speed, inversions, and G-force.
Visualization: Generate insightful visualizations to illustrate trends and key findings.
